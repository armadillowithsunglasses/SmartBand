# SmartBand
This repository was made for the course COP315 at IIT Delhi as a part of a 5 member team. Our aim was to create an app which could do sound recognition and 
identify alarming sounds to help hearing impaired persons. We trained a RNN model for sounds recognition and packaged it in an adroid app. 

1. App : this contains the apk file which can be downloaded on an android phone and tested 
2. Smart Band : this contains the files for the app (which can be opened on android studio) and the training code for RNN model
